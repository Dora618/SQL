## World Layoffs

This topic includes two datasets: layoffs.csv and layoffs_v2.csv.
	•	layoffs.csv covers data from March 11, 2020 (the day COVID-19 was declared a pandemic) to March 11, 2023.
	•	layoffs_v2.csv extends the dataset to April 21, 2025, and was sourced from Kaggle.

The layoffs.csv dataset has been cleaned and analyzed. For layoffs_v2.csv, only the additional data not included in layoffs.csv has been cleaned and analyzed to avoid duplication.

The complete dataset is available at Layoffs.fyi.
