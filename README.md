## World Layoffs

This topic explores global layoff trends using two datasets: layoffs.csv and layoffs_v2.csv.

- layoffs.csv covers data from March 11, 2020 (the day COVID-19 was declared a pandemic) to March 11, 2023.
- layoffs_v2.csv extends the dataset through April 21, 2025 and was sourced from Kaggle.

The layoffs.csv dataset has been fully cleaned and analyzed. To avoid duplication, only the new records not present in layoffs.csv have been cleaned and analyzed from layoffs_v2.csv.

The original, complete dataset can be accessed at Layoffs.fyi.
