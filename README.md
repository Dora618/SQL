## üìÅ Projects Overview

### 1. World Layoffs Analysis

- **Description**: An analysis of global layoff trends using two datasets: `layoffs.csv` and `layoffs_v2.csv`.
  - `layoffs.csv`: Covers data from March 11, 2020, to March 11, 2023.
  - `layoffs_v2.csv`: Extends the dataset to April 21, 2025, sourced from Kaggle.
- **Approach**:
  - Cleaned and analyzed `layoffs.csv`.
  - For `layoffs_v2.csv`, only the new records not present in `layoffs.csv` were cleaned and analyzed to avoid duplication.
- **Data Source**: [Layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/)
